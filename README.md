## Development Environment

This project is cross-platform. To avoid noisy commits from changes to line-endings, set autocrlf to true. 
```
git config core.autocrlf true
```

When adding files, you may see the following: **warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in .travis.yml. The file will have its original line endings in your working directory.** It's throwing out your line endings in favor of the standard CRLF ones. It can be ignored.
