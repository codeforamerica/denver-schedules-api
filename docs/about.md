# About Denver Street Sweeping
## What Is Denver Street Sweeping?

Denver Street Sweeping is a web application developed by the 2014 Code for America Fellows in Denver. The app uses Street Sweeping data from the City and County of Denver. It allows residents of Denver to lookup an address and find the corresponding street sweeping schedule for that address. The resident can then sign up for schedule reminders by Email or SMS. The web app is responsive.

## Why was Denver Street Sweeping built?

The project was developed as one of several projects the 2014 Code for America Fellows worked on in Denver. The team discovered the problem after interviewing residents and looking at 311 call data. We found that street sweeping is ongoing concern for Denver residents and set out to help build an app to help residents avoid street sweeping tickets.

## Design Principles

The primary goal of Denver Street Sweeping was to create a simple and straightforward tool that would allow residents to learn about street sweeping near them. 

* **Open data first**: We worked with the City and County of Denver to create an improved street sweeping data set.The previous data was only geospatial and didn’t give address-level detail as to when and where street sweeping would occur in Denver.

* **Simple and accessible**: The web-app functions on both desktop and mobile devices to accommodate different resident’s needs. We focused on creating a simple interface with clear calls to action to direct users.

* **Go to the people**: Rather than asking residents to check the website every day, we use email and SMS reminders, to push information to residents.

Denver Street Sweeping was never intended to be the perfect street sweeping app, but rather a demonstration of how Open Data can be used. There are many improvements that could be made such as translation into different languages, maps, printable calendars, and much more.
